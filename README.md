Your machine must run PHP. Geuza does not use a local server-side database (yet).

Composer was used for autoloading. Not neccessary for the app if you want to do it differently.
	
Server-side: PHP7 (or any version compatible with PSR-4 autoloading. Also: cURL must be enabled.)

Client-side: HTML5, CSS3, JQuery
